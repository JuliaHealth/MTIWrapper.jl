2731341,"Usability and Learnability of RxUniverse, the First Enterprise-Wide App Prescribing Platform Used in an Academic Tertiary Care Hospital","Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the usability of RxUniverse, a novel platform that enables health care providers to directly disseminate proven, evidence-based mobile health apps to patients. Among five pilot clinical sites, 40 physicians and front-line providers were trained on the RxUniverse platform. They were educated on the platform’s functionality and instructed how to prescribe apps to their patients. The well-validated System Usability Score (SUS) was used to assess the usability of the platform. The adoption goal was set as 100 prescriptions of relevant apps within an 8-week pilot period. Within the pilot period, over 2000 apps were prescribed. Nineteen responses were received from the System Usability Score survey, and the platform received a usability score of 84.2, which is in the 96th percentile across all systems. The pilot study outcomes demonstrate the high adoption and usability of the RxUniverse platform. "
2732268,Docbox’s Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE): A New Real Time Clinical and Operational Decision Support and Analytics Platform,"Abstract: Current health IT infrastructure is the biggest single stumbling block for hospitals to adopt innovative solutions to improve patient safety and care. DocBox is a distributed Platform that brings together real time medical device data with other hospital information that provides a vehicle to develop clinical decision support systems, smart alarms, closed loop control and allows viewing of visual analytics to improve clinical and operational efficiency and effectiveness. The bedside hardware consists of a touchscreen and medical device adapter box(es) to connect legacy devices and servers to communicate with enterprise systems. DocBox software builds an encrypted data backbone containing real time medical device data and other hospital based data (EHR, Lab, ADT) into the ICE data model ASTM F2761 - 09(2013) based on ISO 11073, SNOMED CT and LOINC vocabularies. Data visualizations in the form of bedside clinical apps, operational analytics, equipment usage, patient flow and decision support. The clinical ICE, how to access available data, apps and software tools to develop third party apps will be demonstrated. Plans for a DocBox ICE user community forum are underway and will be announced shortly. "
2732301,Real World Case Studies to Build OpenMRS for Point of Care in Resource Constrained Settings,"Abstract: OpenMRS, a collaboratively developed free and open platform for building electronic medical records (EMR), is currently in use in over 1800 facilities, and supports care provision to over 6 million patients worldwide [1]. Traditionally used in a retrospective data entry workflow, there is rapidly growing interest in implementing OpenMRS in a point of care workflow in low and middle-income countries. This panel will share the experience of organizations that have modified and implemented OpenMRS as a point of care system in challenging resource constrained settings, including Haiti, Kenya, and Mozambique. The panel will discuss their approach to developing the software from both a human capacity and technical perspective, their implementation challenges, and plans for OpenMRS in their organization. The panel presentations will emphasize lessons learned, including strategies for management of the both the technical and the human parts of these high impact projects. "
2732265,DATA-DRIVEN MOBILE MEDICAL IMMUNIZATION CLINIC FOR VETERANS,"Abstract: Despite best efforts the immunization rates among veterans remains low. The use of mobile medical vehicles (MMVs) has shown to impact clinical care, but limited work has been done to optimize their location. This informatics project evaluates the use of data analytics and geo-mapping to mobilize a MMV for immunization services to locations with the greatest underutilization of services. Results show up to a 2.4-fold increase in immunization rates with the data-driven approach implemented. "
